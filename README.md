# NMWiFi

The [Python](https://www.python.org) package `nmwifi` provides an API to configure a Wi-Fi device through [NetworkManager](https://networkmanager.dev/) using a fallback Access Point.

Take a look at the project's [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) to see upcoming features (and all the work accomplished).

**Note**: check out the `nmwifi` python package on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/nmwifi> (managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)).

<!-- TODO initially developped for RPI to set up it wifi network to your home router, works for any device that has at least one wireless network interafce and run NetworkManager -->
